CS 250 Portfolio Reflection – Agile and Scrum Practices
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?

I interpret user needs by breaking high-level requirements into clear, actionable user stories that focus on value from the user’s perspective. Writing user stories helps translate abstract expectations into specific functionality by clearly defining who the user is, what they need, and why it matters. Throughout this course, user stories helped guide development priorities, clarify acceptance criteria, and ensure that features aligned with stakeholder goals. This approach also made it easier to adapt to changing requirements while still delivering meaningful functionality.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development iteratively, focusing on delivering small, functional increments that can be reviewed and improved over time. Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives helped structure work while allowing flexibility and continuous improvement. In my future development work, I plan to continue using backlog refinement, iterative delivery, and regular retrospectives to improve both code quality and team collaboration. These practices support adaptability and reduce risk by identifying issues early in the development cycle.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly, collaborating openly, and taking shared responsibility for project success. Effective team members respect diverse perspectives, provide constructive feedback, and remain accountable for their commitments. Throughout this course, Scrum roles and ceremonies reinforced the importance of transparency, trust, and continuous improvement. A strong team member not only contributes technical skills but also supports the team’s ability to adapt, problem-solve, and deliver value consistently.
